Gives you the ability to manage redirects in your Sylius shop.

## Installation


### Step 1: Download the plugin

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the following command to download the latest stable version of this plugin:

```bash
$ composer require setono/sylius-redirect-plugin
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the Composer documentation.


### Step 2: Enable the plugin

Then, enable the plugin by adding it to the list of registered plugins/bundles
in the `config/bundles.php` file of your project:

```php
<?php

return [
    // ...
    
    // Add before SyliusGridBundle
    Setono\SyliusRedirectPlugin\SetonoSyliusRedirectPlugin::class => ['all' => true],
    Sylius\Bundle\GridBundle\SyliusGridBundle::class => ['all' => true],
    
    // ...
];
```

It is **IMPORTANT** to add the plugin before the grid bundle else you will get a an exception saying `You have requested a non-existent parameter "setono_sylius_redirect.model.redirect.class".`

### Step 3: Add configuration
```yaml
# config/routes/setono_sylius_redirect.yaml

setono_sylius_redirect_admin:
    resource: "@SetonoSyliusRedirectPlugin/Resources/config/admin_routing.yaml"
    prefix: /admin
```

```yaml
# config/packages/_sylius.yaml
imports:
    # ...
    
    - { resource: "@SetonoSyliusRedirectPlugin/Resources/config/config.yaml" }
    
    # ...
```
### Step 4: Update database

Use Dotrine migrations to create a migration file and update the database.

```bash
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## What it does

This plugin allows you to create new redirections.

Under the new menu entry `Redirection` in `Configuration`, you can manage redirections.

### Redirection entry

An entry is composed by:
* Source url, relative to your website
* Target URL, can be relative or absolute in case you want to redirect to another website
* Permanent or Temporary (This impact the HTTP response code of the redirection, 301 or 302)
* Enabled
* Redirect only if 404 (to manage potentially dead links)

### Security

There is a built-in security when creating/modifying redirection that prevent creating an infinite loop. This work with infinite recursive checking.

A second security is to prevent same source redirection leading to inconstant redirect.

### Automatic redirect

There is a built-in feature that allows you to automatically create a redirection when changing a product slug.
It also handles the case where it would create an infinite loop and remove the unnecessary redirect.

Example: Having a slug like `/products/a`, renaming it to `/products/b` then renaming it to `/products/a` will result in a redirect from `b` to `a` and will automatically delete the one from `a` to `b`.

### Points of improvements 

The same mechanism could be done for taxon slug, and obviously for any other resource that has a slug. Feel free to submit a PR.
